# The Guns Shoot People (again)

the guns shoot people and shoot monsters and stuff

This is a mod for Quake 2 for IT266's final project.

## Common Deliverables
* Shortcut that Auto-Launches your Mod (`final.lnk`)
* Mod in a Separate Folder (yes)
* README file in GIT that explains HOWTO install and play / test your mod (this file, half)
* UI updates reflecting your Personal Deliverables
* Help Screen to detail how to play your mod in game

## Personal Deliverables
* bots that shoot the weapons for you (can be anything that shuut) (glowing aura with basic colors)
* different weapons' units have different behaviors
* bots have strengths and weaknesses (some units are better versus certain monsters)
* monsters drop loot (scrap) to make more bots
* orders: issue manual commands to the units (think Pikmin C-stick controlling)
