the guns shoot people and shoot monsters and stuff

This is a mod for Quake 2 for IT266's final project.

## Common Deliverables
* Desktop shortcut (`final.lnk`)
* Readme (this file)
* ?? Main menu modification
* ?? Help screen
* ?? HUD modification

## Personal Deliverables
* bots that shoot the weapons for you (can be anything that shuut) (glowing aura with basic colors)
* different weapons' units have different behaviors
* bots have strengths and weaknesses (some units are better versus certain monsters)
* monsters drop loot (scrap) to make more bots
* orders: issue manual commands to the units (think Pikmin C-stick controlling)
